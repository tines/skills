description: Build polished, interactive analytics dashboards for any data source. Use this whenever the request involves a dashboard, data visualization, internal metrics, spend/usage/cost reporting, or any UI that shows data sliced across time, users, categories, or other dimensions — even if the word "dashboard" is never used. Covers cross-filtering, shareable URL state, filter models, legends, transitions, honest handling of incomplete data, and visualization craft. Not needed for a single static chart.

# Building analytics dashboards

Build it as a structured project — components, hooks, and helpers in separate files, not one giant file. Hand-rolled SVG is fine, often better than a chart library for bespoke interactions.

A dashboard answers questions; it isn't a page of charts. Its dimensions (time plus the data's categorical axes) are the product: make every one filterable, cross-linked, and honest about what it can't show.

For the visual identity — type, palette, spacing, and polish — use the **frontend-design** skill, and ask the user for brand guidelines or a reference if the direction isn't clear. This skill covers only what's specific to data and dashboards: pipeline, interaction, and visualization.

## Data pipeline

- Refresh on a schedule, and let users trigger a refresh on demand — debounce/lock it so concurrent loads don't stampede the source. Put the schedule on one entry point that fans out to the fetchers, so cadence lives in one place.
- Fetch incrementally: pull only what's new since the last stored point, but keep a full-backfill path for a cold or empty store.
- Retry transient source failures with backoff, and never overwrite good data with an empty or failed result — a bad fetch leaves the last good data in place.
- Store raw source data under a stable schema and derive everything at read time, so display changes don't force a re-fetch. Store the inputs to a transform, not its output — keep the mapping (e.g. a lookup table) and apply it live, rather than baking mapped values into storage. Keep enough history to backfill or re-derive when the source or your schema changes.
- Aggregate on the fly, but when the raw volume is too large to load and roll up per request, push the aggregation to the source API (query it for pre-summarized data) or precompute rollups on fetch.
- Let users download the data (e.g. CSV): the processed rows behind the current view (respecting active filters, for finance/reporting) and/or the raw records (for their own analysis).

## Everything is a filter, selection is shared

- Clicking any mark (bar, legend entry, table row, node) scopes every other view to it, and dims (not removes) the rest of the clicked chart.
- Selection toggles: click again or `Esc` to clear. Never strand the user in a dead-end (a flow diagram filtered to one node shows nothing — exit the filter instead).
- Don't filter to a value that can't resolve — an "Others"/"+N more" bucket isn't real; expand it on hover.
- Drill-down: clicking one side of a relationship diagram can expand it and filter the other.

## Shareable URL state

Encode all view state in the URL (tab, date range, filters, grouping, granularity, scale, drill-down) so any view shares by copying the address. Keep param names matching the labels users see.

## Filters

- Multi-select by default, with an include/exclude mode ("only these" vs "all except these"). Show a count when collapsed.
- When one dimension groups another, put the parent first and scope the child's options to the parent's selection.
- Default to a recent window grouped by the dimension people care about most — not "all time", not the first column.
- Don't offer a granularity coarser than the window; disable options that can't apply.

## Legends

- Default the legend to the whole visible period, so its prominence matches the chart — not the last data point.
- Break data down per bucket only on select/hover, and pin it to a selection so it survives the mouse leaving.
- A legend that changes height must not reflow the chart; an inline hovered-label often beats a static block.

## Layout stability

The page must not jump. Reserve space so changing a filter, opening a custom-range control, or toggling a mode never shifts the title, toolbar, or charts by a pixel. Keep the header consistent across tabs. Avoid stray scrollbars.

## Transitions and the remount trap

- Animate values, not existence: a filtered-out series shrinks to zero, it doesn't vanish. Animate ticks, gridlines, and scale changes too.
- Only the data marks move on a filter change; the chart around them shouldn't repaint.
- Footgun: changing a React `key` (or whatever identity a transition depends on) remounts the element — the usual cause of marks flickering, vanishing, or staying empty until hover. Key on a stable series id, not a filtered index or a changing value, and fix it once, not per chart.

## Transparency about incomplete data

- A dynamic banner composed from whichever caveats apply — never warnings scattered around the page — and only on views where the caveat is relevant, not on totals it doesn't touch.
- Label each kind of missing data distinctly; don't merge them into one vague bucket.
- Prefer stale over missing, and "Loading…" over internal state — never leak "no data files yet".
- Don't show an incomplete period as complete: drop the current partial period from preset windows, show it only on custom ranges, and warn when a range includes it.

## Numbers and visualization craft

- Round to consistent significant figures; more decimals only where small magnitudes need them. Use tabular numerals so figures align. Offer an absolute-vs-share (%) toggle.
- Log/linear toggle for skewed data — linear alone hides the tail.
- Top-N + "Others" for high-cardinality series.
- Borrow techniques from data journalism (Tufte, Few, Economist, Bostock): labeled round-number gridlines, distribution views (beeswarm/strip with median, mean, percentiles). Delete decoration that carries no information — stray outlines, redundant legends, a number shown twice.
- Make charts self-explanatory: if you'd explain an encoding in chat, put that in the UI.
- Give series a dedicated categorical color scale (distinct from the UI's brand/chrome colors). Related categories get related colors — shades of a hue per family, a distinct hue per group — and treat a natural grouping as its own dimension. Ask the user whether the audience needs a color-blind-safe palette; if so, use a qualitative scheme designed for it (e.g. Paul Tol's / SRON schemes) and back color with a second cue (shape, pattern, direct labels).
- Sort each chart by its meaningful axis; put axis labels outside the plot so marks never cover them.

## Affordances and accessibility

`cursor: pointer` on everything clickable, including custom SVG marks. Scope `user-select: none` to chart labels and chrome — never the whole app, or users can't copy real text. Keyboard activation on custom marks, and honor `prefers-reduced-motion`. Confirm with the user whether the dashboard needs to meet accessibility requirements (screen readers); if so, give charts ARIA roles and text alternatives (a caption or data-table fallback), since a screen reader can't read an SVG chart.
